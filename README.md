# Dynamic-Background-Color-Changer
The Dynamic Background Color Changer is a fun and interactive web application that 
dynamically changes the background color of the webpage every second. 
The application generates random RGB color values to provide a unique and 
vibrant visual experience. Users can start and stop the background color transitions 
at their convenience using dedicated buttons.

This project is a great demonstration of JavaScript's ability to manipulate 
the DOM and generate random values, paired with HTML and CSS for structure and 
styling.

# How It Works
